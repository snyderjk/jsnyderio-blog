I recently passed the LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator) exam. While it's one milestone in my certification roadmap, it was one of the most valuable learning experiences I've had. Studying for the LFCS dramatically deepened my understanding of Linux beyond casual desktop use. It gave me the confidence to handle real-world administration tasks.

For the past few years, I’ve used Linux (mostly Mint and Pop!_OS) as my daily driver for development. I was comfortable with Vim/Neovim and general desktop tasks, but my command-line knowledge of Linux internals — networking, user management, storage — was surface-level. LFCS preparation helped me fill in those gaps.

I was initially planning to take the LPIC-1 exam and started studying for it. I saw a deal with the Linux Foundation for vouchers for the LFCS exam as well as the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam, so I took the deal and decided to switch from the LPIC-1 to the LFCS. The study for the LPIC-1 was still a good use of time, as it covered much of the same material. The most significant difference between the two tests is that the LPIC-1 is a multiple-choice test, and the LFCS is a practical exam where you perform tasks on an actual Linux environment. 

The topics covered on the exam cover many aspects of administering a Linux system. Below is a breakdown of the sections.

Operations Deployment25%

Networking 25%

Storage20%

Essential Commands20%

Users and Groups10%

As I only use Linux at home as a single user, many of the topics are just not things that I work on frequently. A lot of study was needed to really meet the requirements for the exam.

I joined KodeKloud and am currently working my way through their DevOps track. They also offer a specific course for the LFCS exam, and I watched the videos and took a collection of notes on the content. The course also provided numerous labs to practice the topics covered in the videos, as well as four mock exams that I found very helpful. I took each of those exams 4 to 5 times to get comfortable with the commands needed to perform the various tasks. I wanted to build muscle memory around the commands so that in the real exam, I would be able to perform those types of functions very quickly. Hopefully, that would leave me more time to work on the questions that I was struggling with. The Linux Foundation also provided a mock exam through killer.sh, which was very helpful in studying for the exam. The first time I took that mock exam, which was one week before the actual exam, I scored 48 out of 75.

The score on that mock exam concerned me, and I wondered if I was ready. The killer.sh mock exam was available for 36 hours, so I spent a considerable amount of time studying the topics covered in that exam. I spend a lot of time researching the questions I struggled with and found a few topics that I wasn't as strong in as I needed to be. I also asked ChatGPT to provide me with a list of issues that people have struggled with on the exam, and I spent several hours researching those topics. (By the way, none of those types of tasks appeared on my version of the LFCS exam.)

For the actual test, I had a strategy to not spend too much time on a question that I was stuck on. The exam interface has an option to flag a question. If I couldn't make any progress on a task after 2 to 3 minutes, I would flag the question and move on to the next question, out of the 17 questions that appeared on my test. I flagged 6 or 7 to revisit. And after answering the last question, I still had about 40 minutes (out of the 2 hours) to work on the problems that had given me issues. I was able to find solutions to many of them. Knowing how to use apropos and man commands is an essential skill to have.

Ultimately, I achieved a 95% score. I was proud of the work I put in and passed the exam on the first try. I will soon start studying for the Kubernetes exam and am currently studying for the Amazon AWS Solution Architect Associate certification.
