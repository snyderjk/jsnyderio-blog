# I Passed the LFCS

I knew there was a lot about Linux that I wasn't very knowledgable in, but studying for the LFCS made me much more comfortable with the Linux environment

I recently passed the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) exam with a 95%, and while it’s just one step on my certification roadmap, it’s been one of the most valuable learning experiences of my career. I went from casual Linux desktop user to feeling confident in real-world system administration tasks.

This post shares how I prepared, what the exam was like, and what I’d recommend to others on the same path.

## My Linux Background

I’ve used Linux daily for years, mostly Mint and Pop!\_OS as my development environment. I was comfortable using Vim/Neovim, installing packages, managing dotfiles, and tweaking desktop settings.

But when it came to real system administration—networking, storage, user management, service control—my knowledge was surface-level at best. The LFCS preparation helped me finally connect those missing pieces.

## Why I Chose LFCS Over LPIC-1

I originally planned to take the LPIC-1 exam and had already started studying for it. Then I found a bundle deal from the Linux Foundation that included both the LFCS and CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator).

I made the switch, and I’m glad I did.

The biggest difference? LPIC-1 is multiple choice. LFCS is fully hands-on. You complete real tasks in a live Linux environment. It aligned better with how I like to learn and what I wanted to gain.

## What’s on the LFCS Exam?

Here’s the general breakdown of the LFCS topic areas:

### LFCS Topic Weights
- **Operations & Deployment** – 25%
- **Networking** – 25%
- **Storage** – 20%
- **Essential Commands** – 20%
- **Users & Groups** – 10%

Since I typically use Linux as a single user at home, many of these topics—especially networking and storage—were outside my day-to-day experience. I had to study each section intentionally and thoroughly.

## How I Studied

### KodeKloud

My primary resource was [**KodeKloud**](https://kodekloud.com), specifically their LFCS course. It includes:
- Video lessons
- Hands-on labs for each topic
- Four mock exams (which I took 4–5 times each to build muscle memory)

This repetition really helped me get faster and more confident with the command-line tasks.

### Killer.sh Mock Exam

One week before the real exam, I took the killer.sh mock exam provided by the Linux Foundation. My score: 48 out of 75.

That result gave me pause, maybe I wasn't as ready as I thought,

Over the next four days, I:
- Reviewed every topic I missed
- Deep-dived into the docs
- Asked ChatGPT to help identify common pain points and gaps
- Focused on commands I wasn’t fluent in

None of the topics ChatGPT gave me to review actually showed up on the test—but the exercise made me feel more prepared.

## My Exam Day Strategy

The LFCS exam gave me 17 tasks and 2 hours. Here’s how I approached it:

- Skip and flag: If I couldn’t make meaningful progress in 2–3 minutes, I flagged the question and moved on.
- Leave buffer time: I finished the initial pass with ~40 minutes left, which gave me time to return to tricky questions.
- Use man and apropos: Knowing how to quickly look up unfamiliar commands helped me work through uncertainty without panicking.

## The Result

I passed with a 95% score on my first attempt. I was genuinely proud—not just of the result, but of how much I had learned along the way.

The LFCS forced me to understand what’s really happening under the hood in Linux. It made me a better problem-solver and gave me the confidence to take on more complex DevOps and Kubernetes work in the future.

---

## What’s Next?

I'm currently studying for:
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

KodeKloud’s DevOps track has been a solid guide, and I plan to continue using their platform as I prepare for the next milestones.

## Final Tips for LFCS Candidates

- Practice hands-on, don’t rely on just watching videos.
- Spend extra time on topics you don’t use day-to-day.
- Build muscle memory, especially for things like `iptables`, `mount`, `lvm`, `docker`, and `git`.
- Leave time during the test to revisit flagged questions.
- Use `man`, `apropos`, and `--help` efficiently during the exam.
